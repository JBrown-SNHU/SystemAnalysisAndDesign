# SystemAnalysisAndDesign
CS-255 System Analysis and Design at SNHU

Summary of Projects:

Question: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Liam the owner of DriverPass, wanted us to design a cloud-based system whose purpose what to serve as a way to help train young adults for their DMV tests (for their learners and driver’s license). The system is to contain user-based roles where the experience and level of interaction with the system depend upon the user's role. 

-Students: should be able to log in to their account to take online practice tests to help study for their DMV written test, and make reservations for behind-the-wheel driving with an instructor to prepare for their DMV driving test.

-Teachers: should be able to make reservations for students on their behalf, manage or delete any reservation, and look up information regarding any reservation.

-Admins: should be able to do everything a teacher can do, as well as add/delete/modify user accounts and inventory (such as vehicles and student packages).
	
Question: What did you do particularly well?

For this project, I really like the ideas I put forth on the performance requirements side, more specifically with the security features, such as how accounts are locked after three unsuccessful attempts to prevent any brute force hacks on user accounts.
	
Question: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
	
When designing these documents, I did not account for the need for user feedback to help improve the overall system. When the system is developed, even after testing, there are bound to be a few issues missed by the testers and developers. Adding a “user feedback” and “report issues” link will better help the maintenance team identify and assess areas that need further work when going through the maintenance cycle.
	
Question: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	
By first identifying what the client wants the system to do, and from there, thinking of the system's non-functional requirements and how to implement them along with the functional requirements (such as the system’s security and performance). By addressing the non-functional requirements of the system while designing the needs of the system, you will ultimately design a secure system that is able to handle the users’ needs, versus attempting to meet the design requirements first and making the non-functional requirements a mere afterthought, which may result in a system that may meet the requested specifications; however, ultimately fails as a proper and secure system.
	
Question: How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
	
I think it is a wise idea to analyze all the requirements of a system before designing officially begins. This will help cut down on wasted effort and rework from things not being designed correctly the first time, and help to raise overall efficiency by planning out the system ahead of time. This will also allow the team leads to consider key factors, such as any assumptions, limitations, or time constraints that might hinder the completion of the system.
